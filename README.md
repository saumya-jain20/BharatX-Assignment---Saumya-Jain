# Multi-Server HTTPS Setup with SSL/TLS Encryption

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of multiple HTTPS servers running concurrently on different ports using Python. Each server handles GET requests, logs client information, and sends a "Hello, world!" response over secure SSL/TLS connections. The servers are managed using threading to enable concurrency. The project includes detailed logging, error handling, and graceful shutdown capabilities.

## Features
- **Multiple HTTPS Servers**: Servers run securely using SSL/TLS encryption.
- **Concurrency with Threading**: Each server instance runs on a separate thread, enabling concurrent execution.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs client requests with port-specific information, including timestamps.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: The servers shut down safely when interrupted (e.g., using `Ctrl+C`).
- **Custom Request Handling**: Responds with "Hello, world!" for GET requests.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- SSL/TLS certificates (`cert.pem` and `key.pem`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Place your SSL/TLS certificate files (`cert.pem` and `key.pem`) in the same directory as the code, or update the paths in the script.

## Running the Project
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the servers:
   ```bash
   python assignment.py
   ```

The script will start servers on ports 8000, 8001, and 8002, each running in its own thread.

## Logging
The logs provide detailed information about incoming requests, including the clientâ€™s IP address and the port number of the server handling the request. Logs are written to the console and include timestamps.

Example log:
```
2024-12-06 10:15:30,123 - [PORT 8000] Received GET request from ('127.0.0.1', 12345)
```

## Stopping the Servers
To stop the servers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. The servers will shut down gracefully.

## Code Structure
- **https_server.py**: The main script that sets up and runs the HTTPS servers.
- **RequestHandler**: Custom handler for processing GET requests.
- **run_server**: Function to initialize and start a server on a specific port.

## Use Cases
- **Microservices Architecture**: Host multiple services securely on separate ports.
- **API Gateways**: Serve secure API endpoints concurrently.
- **Testing & Debugging**: Simulate multi-server environments for system testing.

### Notes
- Update the paths to your SSL/TLS certificate files before running the project.
- The servers will run indefinitely until manually stopped, and they will handle multiple incoming requests concurrently.
